      A unique game
      <strong>(multiplayer race manager!)</strong>.
      The game is written purely in javascript/typescript, with a node js (typescript) backend and a nuxt(vue but cooler) electron js frontend
      <strong>pure css</strong> to be accessible for everybody and easy to contribute.

      there were some alternatives for this project that existed. Unfortunately all of them weren't close enough to a race engineer for me.
      So while i tried to keep the game aspect big I also tried to move much closer to a realistic experience.

      (and also multiplayer!)

      In this game you need to manage your race team and drivers, think of the strategy.

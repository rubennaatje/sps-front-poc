    <p>A modern and minimal CSS framework for terminal lovers.</p>

    <h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
    <p>
      Terminal CSS has no overhead and is lightweight
      <strong>(~ 3k gzip)</strong>.
      The source is written in
      <strong>pure css</strong> to be accessible for everybody and easy to contribute.

        there were some alternatives for this project that existed. Unfortunately all of them weren't close enough to a race engineer for me.
        So while i tried to keep the game aspect big I also tried to move much closer to a realistic experience.

        (and also multiplayer!)

        In this game you need to manage your race team and drivers, think of the strategy.
